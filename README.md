# Property Price Prediction with XGBoost

Welcome to the Property Price Prediction project! This initiative leverages the powerful XGBoost algorithm to forecast real estate values, aiming to assist both individuals and professionals in making informed decisions within the property market.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project employs a dataset enriched with various property attributes to train an XGBoost regression model. Our goal is to provide accurate property price estimations, thereby facilitating a smoother decision-making process for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts alike.

### Key Features

- **Numerical Attributes:** Surface area, location coordinates, energy consumption, and more.
- **Categorical Attributes:** Property type, region, heating type, and others.
- **Handling of Data:** Techniques include missing value imputation and categorical variable encoding.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and more for model performance assessment.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12 
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.

## ðŸ“Š Model Training and Evaluation

To train the model and evaluate its performance, run the training script: python XGB.train.py

This process involves data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation against our metrics.

## ðŸ›  Usage
Follow the instructions in `XGB.train.py` for preparing the dataset and making predictions with the trained model. The script details the expected data format and how to call the prediction function.
